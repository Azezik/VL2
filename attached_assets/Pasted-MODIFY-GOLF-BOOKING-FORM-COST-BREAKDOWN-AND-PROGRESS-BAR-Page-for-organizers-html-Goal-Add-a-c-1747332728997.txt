MODIFY GOLF BOOKING FORM – COST BREAKDOWN AND PROGRESS BAR
Page: for-organizers.html
Goal: Add a cost summary and progress bar below the "Number of Players" field to reflect green fee, booking fee, optional add-ons, and a split total per player.
 
1.	Add a new section under the "Number of Players" field to display the following values:
•	Green Fee (based on location and game type)
•	Booking Fee (always $3.00)
•	Total cost of add-ons (based on what is selected and which course is chosen)
•	Grand Total
•	Per Player Cost (Grand Total divided by number of players)
•	Progress bar showing what percent of the group is committed, based on the number of players
Always assume the person posting the ad is interested, so progress bar should start at 1 divided by the total number of players (e.g., 25% for 4 players, 33% for 3, etc).
